# PrismPHP
PrismPHP is a framework dedicated to be a project setup solution. It includes a view/api router, a MySQL database switchboard, data sanitizer and validators, a PHPMailer shortcut, a dev/prod project bundler and a bug tracker. 

NOTE: The Master branch is not ready yet. To see what I am working on, you may check the beta branch (unstable).
